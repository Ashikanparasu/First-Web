	      <big>Traveling is a very crucial part of life as it is the best way to get out of the busy schedule. It is also to experience life in different ways.
	         Traveling is actually a good remedy for stress, anxiety and depression. It also improves the mental and physical health. We only have one life 
			 and we should thank it for making us more advanced creature on this planet. Not only do we get to experience the beauty of nature, different
			 geographies ,topographies, and people. Traveling is all about exploring new places, cultures, cuisines, rituals and styles of living. We also 
			 travel because distance and difference are the secret toxic of learning and creativity which one cannot observe by sitting at home. Traveling in 
			 itself has advantages, as it makes one forget his or her worries, problems, frustrations and fears. This helps by broadening your horizon to
			 move in new directions, unplugging from the pulls and pushes of daily life. We have a passport to fill full of stamps rather  than to have a 
			 house full of stuff. Let’s use this to make memories all over the world.
