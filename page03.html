   that a traveller must visit in Tamil Nadu. This town in the district of the same name is primarily famous for its Hindu temple and the annual chariot 
   festival. Apparently, the religious tourism is at peak here. Thiruvarur was one of the five traditional capitals of the Chola Empire, and the history of 
   the famed Thyagaraja Temple also goes back to this same era. The chariot festival in Thiruvarur is something that not only a Hindu devotee would relish 
   witnessing, but a tourist would be delighted too. Belonging to the Thyagaraja Temple, it is the largest chariot in Tamil Nadu, and thus, sighting it on a 
   visit to Thiruvarur is recommended. It will be best to plan a trip to this sacred town in Tamil Nadu during the Chariot Festival which takes place in the 
   month of April/May. The meandering River Odambokki that flows through the centre of the town adds to its natural beauty. Though there is not much to see
   in the town apart from the temple, the chariot, an art gallery and the Kamalayan Tank, you can still enjoy a pleasant holiday here amidst a serene 
   environment.Thiruvarur has some temples and wildlife sanctuaries in its proximity for travellers to enhance their experience in this town of South India. 
   Those with the inclination towards bird watching can visit Vaduvur Bird Sanctuary, some 25 km from Thiruvarur. The sanctuary is home to 20,000 birds of 
   about 40 different species of water birds that visit here mostly during the migratory season. Some odd 60 km from Thiruvarur is Muthupettai which is 
   particularly known for its 700 years old mosque and a massive lagoon created by a number of rivers, is a must-see destination around Thiruvarur. Apart 
   from this, the entire district of Thiruvarur is replete with majestic temples amongst which Thiruveezhimalai, Thirupampuram, Tirumeichur, Srivanjiyam,

	    <br>
	     <br>
	      <big>Traveling is a very crucial part of life as it is the best way to get out of the busy schedule. It is also to experience life in different ways.
	         Traveling is actually a good remedy for stress, anxiety and depression. It also improves the mental and physical health. We only have one life 
			 and we should thank it for making us more advanced creature on this planet. Not only do we get to experience the beauty of nature, different
			 geographies ,topographies, and people. Traveling is all about exploring new places, cultures, cuisines, rituals and styles of living. We also 
			 travel because distance and difference are the secret toxic of learning and creativity which one cannot observe by sitting at home. Traveling in 
			 itself has advantages, as it makes one forget his or her worries, problems, frustrations and fears. This helps by broadening your horizon to
			 move in new directions, unplugging from the pulls and pushes of daily life. We have a passport to fill full of stamps rather  than to have a 
			 house full of stuff. Let’s use this to make memories all over the world.
